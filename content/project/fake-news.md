title: "Understanding and countering online misinformation"
subtitle: ""
summary: "In this project, I am exploring some of the effects of online misinformation on outcomes such as political and media polarization, as well as investigate factors — both individual-level and contextual — that promote or diminish the effect of misinformation.  There are significant theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms by which misinformation affects various outcomes such as factual beliefs, public opinions, political and social indicators and how that process varies across individuals and in different contexts. My research aims to address these gaps. Further, I am interested in examining how individuals interpret corrective information and respond to narratives countering misperceptions."
