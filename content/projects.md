## **Understanding and countering online misinformation**

In this project, I am exploring some of the effects of online misinformation on outcomes such as political and media polarization, as well as investigate factors — both individual-level and contextual — that promote or diminish the effect of misinformation.  There are significant theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms by which misinformation affects various outcomes such as factual beliefs, public opinions, political and social indicators and how that process varies across individuals and in different contexts. My research aims to address these gaps. Further, I am interested in examining how individuals interpret corrective information and respond to narratives countering misperceptions.

## **Labor and Litigation: Effect of unions**

In this project, I look at the rise in wage and hour cases filed by nonunion workers in the US under Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and explore the role of labor unions in advancing legal mobilization among workers.

## **Effect of NIH-ARRA funding on scientific productivity**

In this study, my co-author Seungwon Lee and I measure the causal effect of the NIH funding disbursed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 on scientific productivity. Additionally, we test whether the causal effect of ARRA funding varies by gender.
